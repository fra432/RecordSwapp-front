        Near Mint(NM)
      </h4>
      <p
        className="description"
      >
        A nearly perfect record. A NM or M- record has more than likely never been played, and the vinyl will play perfectly, with no imperfections during playback. Many dealers won't give a grade higher than this implying (perhaps correctly) that no record is ever truly perfect. The record should show no obvious signs of wear.

        Very Good Plus(VG+)
      </h4>
      <p
        className="description"
      >
        Generally worth 50% of the Near Mint value. A Very Good Plus record will show some signs that it was played and otherwise handled by a previous owner who took good care of it. Defects should be more of a cosmetic nature, not affecting the actual playback as a whole.

        Very Good(VG)
      </h4>
      <p
        className="description"
      >
        Generally worth 25% of Near Mint value. Many of the defects found in a VG+ record will be more pronounced in a VG disc. Surface noise will be evident upon playing, especially in soft passages and during a song's intro and fade,.

        Good(G)
      </h4>
      <p
        className="description"
      >
        Generally worth 10-15% of the Near Mint value. A record in Good or Good Plus condition can be played through without skipping. But it will have significant surface noise, scratches, and visible groove wear.

        Poor(P)
      </h4>
      <p
        className="description"
      >
        Generally worth 0-5% of the Near Mint price. The record is cracked, badly warped, and won't play through without skipping or repeating.
